## 1. Robotics Course: Action Model Learning with Guarantees

| Status | Topic | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **In Progress** | **Action Model Learning** | Analysis and Implementation of the "Action Model Learning with Guarantees" approach by E. Scala and D. Aineto. The project aims to develop an algorithm implementation that learns sound and complete PDDL action models from observed agent transitions, applying the methodology to standard literature problems. |

Since the project is a work-in-progress, details about the progress of the work are available in the [specific repository](https://github.com/claudiometelli/action-model-learning-guarantees).
